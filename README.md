Game Theory course project.
There are three models in this repository first two are static models.


Static models:-
Model 1 has its utility in Utility_function_alpha_beta_gamma.py and uses the simultion from Simulation_Function.py
Model 2 has its utility from Utility_function_alpha_beta.py and its also uses the simulation from Simulation_Function.py



Dynamic Models:-
Model 3 can be run directly form Final Code (SIER-SH).ipynb.
